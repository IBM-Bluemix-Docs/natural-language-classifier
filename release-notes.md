{: shortdesc}

## Beta features
{: #beta}

{{site.data.keyword.IBM_notm}} releases services, features, and language support for your evaluation that are classified as beta. These features might be unstable, might change frequently, and might be discontinued with short notice. Beta features also might not provide the same level of performance or compatibility that generally available features provide and are not intended for use in a production environment. Beta features are supported only on [developerWorks Answers ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](https://developer.ibm.com/answers/topics/natural-language-classifier.html){: new_window}.

## Changes
{: #changelog}

The following new features and changes to the service are available.

### 7 August 2018
{: #07august2018}

**Classic toolkit replaced**

The classic toolkit is shut down as of August 7, 2018 and is replaced by  [{{site.data.keyword.DSX}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")][watson-studio-reg]{: new_window}.

You can [migrate](/docs/services/natural-language-classifier/tool-overview.html#migrating) the training data for classifiers created outside of {{site.data.keyword.DSX}} until September 30, 2018. After you migrate, you can easily update the training data and create another classifier within {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}.

### 2 August 2018
{: #02august2018}

**Migrate your training data to {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}**

You can now [migrate](/docs/services/natural-language-classifier/tool-overview.html#migrating) the training data for classifiers created outside of {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}. After you migrate, you can easily update the training data and create another classifier within {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}.

You can migrate data until September 30, 2018.

### 6 July 2018
{: #06july2018}

**New beta tool available: {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}**

{{site.data.keyword.DSX}} is the new integrated environment that includes a replacement for the earlier classic {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifiershort}} toolkit. To get started with {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}, click **Launch tool** from a {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifiershort}} service instance dashboard. For details, see [Managing classifiers with {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}](/docs/services/natural-language-classifier/tool-overview.html#studio).

{{site.data.keyword.DSX}} supports not only {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifiershort}} but also {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} and many other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services and resources. {{site.data.keyword.DSX}} provides a collaborative environment in the cloud. With {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}, developers, subject matter experts, data scientists, and others can build and train {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifiershort}} and other AI models. You can also use {{site.data.keyword.DSX}} to test your classifiers.

You can use {{site.data.keyword.DSX}} with all your existing {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifiershort}} instances and classifiers. The classic toolkit remains available until August 7, 2018.

### 8 June 2018
{: #08june2018}

**Download your training data for the new tool**

The existing {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifiershort}} classic toolkit is scheduled to shut down July 31, 2018. The planned replacement for the toolkit is **{{site.data.keyword.DSX}}**, the new integrated environment. [{{site.data.keyword.DSX}} ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")][watson-studio-reg]{: new_window} already supports {{site.data.keyword.visualrecognitionshort}} and other {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}} services and resources.

We expect that all of your existing classifiers will be available in {{site.data.keyword.DSX}}. However, if you want to make sure that you can re-create your existing classifiers, download the training data from the classic toolkit before July 31, 2018.

For those who use the [API ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-classifier/api/v1){: new_window} directly, there is no change with the tool migration.

### 16 March 2018
{: #16march2018}

- **Classify multiple phrases**

    A new **Classify multiple phrases** method is available that supports sending up to 30 text phrases in one request. The `POST /v1/classifiers/{classifier_id}/classify_collection` method supports classifying phrases in the same languages as for the original method, except for Japanese, which launches as a beta feature.

    For details about the API call, see the **Classify multiple phrases** method in the [API reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/curl.html?curl#classify-multiple-phrases){:new_window}.

- **Train with larger data sets**

    You can now include up to 20,000 records in your training data. Classifier training is now enhanced by IBM Deep Learning as a Service. This offering is a neural network training infrastructure that uses an elastic cluster of graphics processing units (GPU) to handle larger data sets. The maximum size of the training data remains at 15,000 records for users in the Frankfurt region or users withÂ IBM Cloud Dedicated.

### 10 July 2017
{: #10july2017}

**Additional languages:** The service now supports Korean in addition to Arabic, English, French, German, Japanese, Italian, Portuguese, and Spanish. The language of the training data must match the language of the text that you intend to classify.

For details about languages, see [Using your own data](/docs/services/natural-language-classifier/using-your-data.html#languages). For details about the API call, see the `Create classifier` method in the [API reference ![External link icon](../../icons/launch-glyph.svg "External link icon")](http://www.ibm.com/watson/developercloud/natural-language-classifier/api/v1/){:new_window}.
