# Activity Tracker events
{: #at_events}

As a security officer, auditor, or manager, you can use the Activity Tracker service to track how users and applications interact with {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifierfull}} in {{site.data.keyword.cloud}}.
{: shortdesc}

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} records user-initiated activities that change the state of a service in {{site.data.keyword.cloud_notm}}. You can use this service to investigate abnormal activity and critical actions and to comply with regulatory audit requirements. In addition, you can be alerted about actions as they happen. The events that are collected comply with the Cloud Auditing Data Federation (CADF) standard. For more information, see that the getting started tutorial for [{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}}](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-getting-started).

## List of events
{: #at_actions}

The following table lists the {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifiershort}} actions that generate an event.

## Viewing events
{: #at_ui}

Events that are generated by an instance of the {{site.data.keyword.nlclassifiershort}} service are automatically forwarded to the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service instance that is available in the same location.

{{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} can have only one instance per location. To view events, you must access the web UI of the {{site.data.keyword.at_full_notm}} service in the same location where your service instance is available. For more information, see [Launching the web UI through the IBM Cloud UI](/docs/activity-tracker?topic=activity-tracker-launch#launch_cloud_ui).
